### CURRENT WORK

- **Research Assistant**, [Duke-UNC BECR Center](https://becr.sanford.duke.edu), *Duke University (Jan 2015 – Present)*
	- Data science work investigating food purchasing behavior, food-related health outcomes, and food assistance policy (SNAP/WIC). The aim is to uncover trends that can help BECR design behavioral nudges to improve food choices. Also helping write papers/proposals and providing analytical results (graphics, tables, etc).
- **Teaching Assistant**, Sanford School of Public Policy, *Duke University (Spring 2015)*
	- Co-taught *PubPol 590 Applied Big Data Science Energy Data Analytics and Policy* with Dr. Matthew Harding. Students learned introductory theory about causal inference (taught by Harding) and how to use Python to analyze large datasets (taught by me). The goal was for students to finish the class with the capacity to do basic consulting for energy companies.
- **SSRI Visiting Student Research Fellow**, Social Science Research Institute, *Duke University (August 2014 – Jan 2015)*	
	- Provided consulting services to Duke University faculty and students through PARISS.

### SAMPLE OF CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS

- *“Closing the Nutrition Gap: Policy Simulations Using Scanner Data” (Dissertation Chapter)*
	- Estimate via simulation the demand-side effect of targeted subsidies (e.g. subsidies of fruits and vegetables) for SNAP eligible participants using transaction-level scanner data of food purchases. The goal is to see if price subsidies are sufficient for closing the “nutrition gap” observed between the low and high income household.
- *“Disadvantaged and Healthy: Understanding the Purchasing Behavior of Positive Deviants* with Matthew Harding
	- On average, disadvantaged homes (impoverished, minority, low education) have worse health outcomes. However, there is a subset of disadvantaged households with great overall health ("positive deviants"). We study the purchasing behavior of these outlier households to help identify achievable and realistic policy recommendations.
- *“Understanding the Statistical Properties of IRI Store-based and House-based Scanner Data”* with Matthew Harding and Ya Xue (USDA Grant)
	- Analysis of food scanner data the USDA purchased from IRI. The goals of the grant can be broadly categorized into assessing the suitability of the IRI for nutrition policy research and comparing the IRI data to other publicly available data sets.
