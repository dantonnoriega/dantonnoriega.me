Saludos! My name is Danton Noriega-Goodwin. I'm a PhD student at Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu) and a Research Assistant at the [Duke-UNC BECR Center](https://becr.sanford.duke.edu/).

I have a BS in Applied Math from the University of California-Irvine, an MS in Applied Statistics from California State University–Long Beach, and an MA in Economics from Georgetown. My research focus is in applied econometrics using large data sets to study taxes and food purchasing behavior. I'm interested in local taxation, food/nutrition/health inequality, and computational methods. In the main chapter of my dissertation, I investigate how changes in local tax rates on food affect consumer purchasing behavior, particularly for junk foods and beverages.

I love programming and spend far too many hours honing my programming skills relative to writing and reading papers. I'm consider myself 50% data scientist, 50% computer scientist, and 50% economist. The [man-pear-pig](http://ultinomics.github.io/dantonnoriega.me/images/man-bear-pig.jpg) of applied econometrics. 

When I'm not programming or doing research for myself or my advisor, [Dr. Matthew Harding](http://people.duke.edu/~mch55/), I'm thinking about [ultimate](http://ultiworld.com/), training for [ultimate](http://skydmagazine.com/column/training-blog/), or playing [ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI) -- especially [beach ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCCvjiTxhLY).
