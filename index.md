Saludos! My name is Danton Noriega-Goodwin. I'm a PhD student at Duke University's [Sanford School of Public Policy](http://sanford.duke.edu) and a Research Assistant at the [Durham Children's Data Center](http://childandfamilypolicy.duke.edu/project/durham-childrens-data-center/).

I have a BS in Applied Math from the University of California-Irvine, an MS in Applied Statistics from California State Universityâ€“Long Beach, and an MA in Economics from Georgetown. My research focus is in applied econometrics using large data sets to study incentives and food purchasing behavior. I'm interested in data science, taxes/subsidies, food/nutrition/health inequality, and computational methods. In the main chapter of my dissertation, I investigate the effectiveness of targeted fruit and vegetable subsidies as a policy for improving the health of SNAP beneficiaries. My advisors are [Dr. Matthew Harding](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~harding1/) and [Anna Gassman-Pines](https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/gassman-pines-anna).

When I'm not programming or doing research, I'm thinking about [ultimate](http://ultiworld.com/), training for [ultimate](http://skydmagazine.com/column/training-blog/), or playing [ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI) -- especially [beach ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCCvjiTxhLY).
