Saludos! My name is Danton Noriega-Goodwin. I'm a Data Scientist at Apple working on modeling global iCloud infrastructure and services demand. 

I earned my PhD in Public Policy (economics concentration) from [Duke University](http://sanford.duke.edu) in August 2019. The title of my dissertation is "*Doubled SNAP Dollars and Nudges: An Analysis of Two Pilot Programs Aimed at Increasing the Purchase of Healthy Foods*". I also have a BS in Applied Math from the University of California-Irvine, an MS in Applied Statistics from California State Universityâ€“Long Beach, and an MA in Economics from Georgetown.

When I'm not working or programming, I'm thinking about [ultimate](http://ultiworld.com/), training for [ultimate](http://skydmagazine.com/column/training-blog/), or playing [ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI) -- especially [beach ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCCvjiTxhLY) and [goaltimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1tqM--sCVk).
