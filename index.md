Saludos! My name is Danton Noriega-Goodwin. I'm a fourth year PhD student in Economics at Georgetown Univeristy, currently visiting Duke University as a Research Assistant at the [Duke-UNC BECR Center](https://becr-dev.oit.duke.edu/).

I have a BS in Applied Math from the University of California-Irvine, an MS in Applied Statistics from California State Universityâ€“Long Beach, and an MA in Economics from Georgetown. My research focus is in applied econometrics using large data sets to study food purchasing behavior. I'm interested in food/nutrition/health inequality and computational methods related to "[big data](http://bigdataeconometrics.com/)". The main chapter of dissertation is on the effictiveness of fruit/vegetable subsidies as a policy and the impact it has on the demand for other products. The other chapters of my dissertation focus on how/what food purchasing behavior contributes to health disparities.

I love programming and spend far too many hours honing my programming skills relative to writing and reading papers. I'm consider myself 50% data scientist, 50% computer scientist, and 50% economist. The [man-pear-pig](http://ultinomics.github.io/dantonnoriega.me/images/man-bear-pig.jpg) of applied econometrics. 

When I'm not programming or doing research for myself or my advisor, [Dr. Matthew Harding](http://people.duke.edu/~mch55/), I'm thinking about [ultimate](http://ultiworld.com/), training for [ultimate](http://skydmagazine.com/column/training-blog/), or playing [ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq3pg0JcJSI) -- especially [beach ultimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCCvjiTxhLY).
